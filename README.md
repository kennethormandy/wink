# Wink

Responsive emails with personality, based on [Ink](https://github.com/zurb/ink).

Wink is a Sass variation of ZURB’s Ink email framework. It intends to add templates (receipts, product annoucements, newsletters, transactional emails, etc.) with improved default typography and colours, easily configurable through SCSS variables.

## Get started

Wink isn’t quite ready yet, it is still mostly Ink with SCSS variables, but you can view the progress so far with the following commands.

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/kennethormandy/wink
# Move into the folder
cd wink

# Install Harp
npm install -g harp

# Serve the project with Harp
harp server

# Docs now available at http://localhost:9000/docs
open http://localhost:9000/docs
```

## Templates

Wink’s templates are currently in-progress. You can check them out with the following commands.

```bash
# Serve the project with Harp
harp server

# Templates now available at http://localhost:9000/templates
open http://localhost:9000/templates

```
